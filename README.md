Current working implimentations:

1)  Stable Marriage:

    User inputs n "men" and w "women".  The program then uses the stable marriage algoithm (Gale-Shapely) 
    to determine an optimal matching.

2)  Numerical Analysis:
		
		one of the largest code bases.  Has multiple functionality.  The current working algorithms are:
			
				(i) Newtons Method:
						Finds x-axis intersections
